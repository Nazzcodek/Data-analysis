# A D2B Assessment project

Etracted .csv files from S3Bucket into my local storage as in [import_files](https://github.com/Nazzcodek/assesment/tree/main/import_files)
- orders.csv
- reviews.csv
- shipments_deliveries.csv

NB: The shipment_deliveries is the file name for the shipments_deliveries.csv file which was stated wrongly in the brief 

main.tf is the code for terraform

pylint is the linting library

click is command line tool library

black is the formating library
